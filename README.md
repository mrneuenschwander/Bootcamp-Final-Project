# Bootcamp-Final-Project


## Deliverable 1: EDA and choosing a topic.

The first Deliverable of the Final Challenge is straightforward. The goal was to decide on a question, find a dataset that would allow us to answer it effectively, and begin manipulation and modeling of that set. 

The question we decided on came after a long while, and after bouncing from facet to facet within the same subject: the prediction of the NBA's next pool of MVP candidates, more specificallly which factors made a player more likely to be selected? Using a dataset from Kaggle, we ammassed a trove of data to be looked through, and began the EDA process to know what we were working with.

We decided on a "rubberband" approach, where we started in Jupyter, moved it to postgres for further manipulation with SQL, and then back to Python/Colab to create and run a Machine Learning model. The model has yet to be decided, but a Supervised Machine Learner is so far looking to be the most appropriate approach. The SQL
